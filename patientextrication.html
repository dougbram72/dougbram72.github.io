                <ul>
                    <li>When an entrapped patient in encountered, the Sabetha EMS provider should attempt safe access for an initial assessment.  No extrication procedures should be attempted without proper training and equipment.</li>
                    <li>Sabetha EMS does not provide vehicle extrication, heavy rescue, high angle, confined space or other complicated rescue.  Sabetha EMS personnel should not attempt these rescues unless appropriately trained and equipped.  Sabetha Fire and Rescue should be utilized and additional resources as necessary.  Sabetha EMS will assist and cooperate with other agencies during the rescue providing medical care to the patient being extricated to the extent safety allows.  Upon extrication, Sabetha EMS will continue to provide care during treatment and transport</li>
                    <li>Non-entrapped patients are those requiring extrication but do not require specialized equipment or training for their extrication.  Sabetha EMS will follow appropriate techniques to remove patients from any location found in order to initiate and continue care.</li>
